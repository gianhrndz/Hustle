Hi Ranchodas,

We would like to congratulate you for getting into an internship at Microsoft! We’ll be missing you in our learning sessions. 

Per our policies, we have already changed your status and moved you to “Observer” role. Being an observer to the course means:

You’ll still have lifetime access to the course material so you can study it at your own pace. Sounds great, right?
There will be no due dates anymore and no expectations from us.

We want to remain connected so if you want to receive updates on upcoming courses, events, and other opportunities from us, we highly encourage you to join our mailing list. 

Again, congratulations and we wish you all the best in your new endeavor! Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns. 

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
