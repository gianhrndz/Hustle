Hi Raju,

Thanks for reaching out to us, and we really appreciate you taking the time to inform us about your concern.

Your attendance and participation is of utmost importance to us, since we want our learners to get the most out of our learning sessions. That’s why we are requiring everyone to be present for at least 50% of the session. In your case, since each CodePath iOS Course session lasts for one hour, learners are required to stay for at least 30 minutes for their attendance not to be marked as “Absent.” There are course coordinators who check the students’ attendance during the session.  All attendance-related policies can be found at course policies.

Thanks for your understanding! Please feel free to reach out again if you have further questions or any other concerns and we’d be happy to help! See you in our next sessions!

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
