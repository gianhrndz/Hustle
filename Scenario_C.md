Hi Farhan,

Thanks for reaching out to us, and we really appreciate you taking the time to provide this feedback.

We hope you’re feeling better now. As we want to ensure that no learner is left behind and in consideration of the technical issues you’ve encountered, we’re extending the deadline of submission of your assignment for another 24 hrs. Feel free to submit your assignment anytime within the given extension to avoid getting the mark of “Missing”.

You may also help us improve our platform by reaching out to Slack Unit Help Channels (e.g. android-unit05-spring21) or the Discussions System (https://discussions.codepath.com/) and letting them know of the technical issue that you’ve encountered.

Hope this helps! Please feel free to reach out again if you have further questions or any other concerns and we’d be happy to help!

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
