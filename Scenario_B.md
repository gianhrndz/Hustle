Hi Pia,

Thanks for reaching out to us, and we really appreciate you taking the time to inform us about your situation.

We understand and appreciate your eagerness to learn.However, as we want our learners to maximize their learning experience with us and get the most out of the sessions, attendance is of utmost importance to our educational model.

We only allow 3 absences with prior notice and unexcused absences (No Call, No Show) are not permitted, even one unexcused absence may result in removal from the course as outlined in our course policies. We usually give second chances for students with extenuating circumstances (ex. Death in the Family, Accident). But in this case, it seems that you have an overwhelming load for the semester and have a full schedule due to work. We are just concerned with your load and we don’t want you to overwork. 

We highly encourage you to sign up again and take the course next semester when you have less load and better availability. You have a great potential in this field and we see it in you. 

In the meantime, there are a lot of resources out there for people interested in learning Cybersecurity, and we’ve done some work to make them more accessible. We have many online resources for learning Cybersecurity including an extensive list of Cybersecurity resources online.

We want to remain connected so if you want to receive updates on upcoming courses, events, and other opportunities from us, we highly encourage you to join our mailing list. 

Thank you for your understanding and we hope to see you again as one of our learners next semester!

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
